**What if i got a chance to 
teach group theory to a bunch 
of niggas ! Listen up Noobs !!**

_Girls :_ cyclic group (except 
prime order)

_Chick Hunters:_ Special type 
of abelian groups.

_Real Men :_ Simple Group (
 non-abelian and higher orders)

_Falling in love :_ Group Homomorphism


> Intresting  thing is : Cyclic groups expect unique trivial homomorphism from abelian groups  and point fingers at simple groups for multiple non-trivial homomorphisms !

That's why simple groups are _so simple_ , Abelian Groups are so _commutative_ and cyclic one's are _too much cyclic._
